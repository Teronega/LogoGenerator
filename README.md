## Description
Objective is to create an OOP that generates a randomized logo for SVG.
This entails building a Node.js command-line application that takes in the users input
for colors and shapes of their choice as well as any additional text they want included on top or bottom.
The program should then generate an svg file with randomly generated elements based off these inputs.
